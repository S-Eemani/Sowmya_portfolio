                      <p class="mb-30 text-justify mx-36">Recognizing the imperative to establish a robust online presence, I took the initiative to give my portfolio a significant overhaul, opting for Svelte Kit as my framework of choice. The decision was fueled by my admiration for the framework's formidable features and functionalities. The sheer power of Svelte Kit inspired me to undertake the task of updating and enhancing my existing portfolio, elevating it to new heights. <br>

                      <br>
                      In this recent project, I delved into various cutting-edge technologies, harnessing the capabilities of ParticleJs, Taiwan CSS, and leveraging the robust routing system provided by Svelte Kit. This endeavor allowed me to craft a visually stunning and highly responsive design, showcasing a seamless and engaging user experience. It was my inaugural experience working with Svelte Kit, and I was thoroughly impressed by its simplicity, efficiency, and the overall development experience it offered.<br>

                      <br>
                      Venturing into front-end development has not been my primary focus, but Svelte Kit proved to be a game-changer, significantly streamlining the development process and enhancing the overall aesthetics of my portfolio website. Having previously worked with ReactJS, I found Svelte Kit to be a breath of fresh air, providing a more intuitive and enjoyable development journey. This positive encounter has sparked a newfound enthusiasm for front-end technologies, thanks to the remarkable impact that Svelte Kit has made on my projects. </p>
