While there are very complex chatbots out there, our chatbot is currently simple, and can display quotes, jokes, or cat images (the functions it can do can be increased and personalized more) upon asking it to do so.</p> <p class="mb-30 text-center">In our project, we have used ​Heroku​, which is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS), to help host our chatbot. We have also used ​Twilio​ (a cloud communications platform) for the WhatsApp interface. Apart from this, we also used a Jokes API, a cat images API, and a quote API. The code for our chatbot is written mainly in Python. We also used the Flask framework.</p> <p class="mb-30 text-center">We used Twilio’s We used Twilio’s ‘Programmable Messaging’ option to set up a sandbox with our account. The WhatsApp number is common to all, but keeping security in mind, Twilio generated a code with the word ‘join’ followed by another code, unique to the account. After all the setup our chatbot is capable of sending jokes, pictures, and reminder messages.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main>`;
